            <h3>Anarchist</h3>
            <p>38SOG is operated on a non-heirarchical consensus-based
            governance model. There are no set leaders. Leadership in the field
            is determined by present need and experience, rather than on fixed
            roles.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Colonial</h3>
            <p>The Colonial Army prides itself on being welcoming and friendly.
            38SOG is proud to be part of these efforts. As such, 38SOG is
            strictly a Colonial group.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Operations</h3>
            <p>38SOG was formed to plan, coordinate, and execute large-scale,
            collaborative, multi-clan operations. We aim to provide the right
            tools to the right people in the right place at the right time.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>

          <h3>Observe - Advise - Mobilize</h3>
          <div class="infogrid">
          <div>
            <h4>The Right Tools</h4>
            <p>Logistics is the backbone of Foxhole. Everything from tanks to
            rifles to respawns is prepared and delivered by players. The
            largest part of providing the right tools to the right people in
            the right place at the right time is having those tools to begin
            with</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>The Right People</h4>
            <p>38SOG knows and works closely with outside players. Our most
            successful operations never involve 38SOG going solo. Our strength
            lies in inviting other players and clans to fill out the roles in
            our operations, allowing us to be the fulcrum for a much larger
            lever.
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>The Right Place</h4>
            <p>Scouting is key to any operation. It's the difference between
            landing a ship on a watchtower-covered beach straight into
            concrete, and crossing a quiet border to walk up to an undefend
            town. 38SOG scouts to identify decayed defenses, unbuilt map
            sections, and targets of opportunity.
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>The Right Time</h4>
            <p>38SOG is primarily NA timezone, but has a substantial contingent
            of Australian and Kiwi players. We plan our operations at least 24
            hours in advance, to give everyone time to clear their schedule and
            be ready.

          <h3>Small Unit Activities</h3>
          <p>38SOG isn't always trying to move the whole map. We spend a lot of
          time on small-unit activities, especially those that reward patience
          and preparation</p>
          <div class="infogrid">
            <div>
              <h4>Artillery</h4>
              <p>To shoot artillery in Foxhole is easy; to do it well is hard.
              38SOG members bring patience and discipline to artillery fire
              missions, in addition to hundreds of shells, allowing us to operate
              effectively and continuously.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Anti-Armor</h4>
              <p>Patience is a recurring theme in 38SOG's small unit gameplay,
              and it shines in our anti-armor work. Anti-tank weapons don't do
              well against structures or enemy troops, but sitting and waiting
              for our chance to strike means we're in position when the enemy
              finally makes their move.<p>
