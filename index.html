        <div id="grid-about">
          <div>
            <h3>Anarchist</h3>
            <p>38SOG is operated on a non-heirarchical consensus-based
            governance model. There are no set leaders. Leadership in the field
            is determined by present need and experience, rather than on fixed
            roles.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Colonial</h3>
            <p>The Colonial Army prides itself on being welcoming and friendly.
            38SOG is proud to be part of these efforts. As such, 38SOG is
            strictly a Colonial group.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Operations</h3>
            <p>38SOG was formed to plan, coordinate, and execute large-scale,
            collaborative, multi-clan operations. We aim to provide the right
            tools to the right people in the right place at the right time.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>

          <h3>Observe - Advise - Mobilize</h3>
          <div class="infogrid">
          <div>
            <h4>The Right Tools</h4>
            <p>Logistics is the backbone of Foxhole. Everything from tanks to
            rifles to respawns is prepared and delivered by players. The
            largest part of providing the right tools to the right people in
            the right place at the right time is having those tools to begin
            with</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>The Right People</h4>
            <p>38SOG knows and works closely with outside players. Our most
            successful operations never involve 38SOG going solo. Our strength
            lies in inviting other players and clans to fill out the roles in
            our operations, allowing us to be the fulcrum for a much larger
            lever.
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>The Right Place</h4>
            <p>Scouting is key to any operation. It's the difference between
            landing a ship on a watchtower-covered beach straight into
            concrete, and crossing a quiet border to walk up to an undefend
            town. 38SOG scouts to identify decayed defenses, unbuilt map
            sections, and targets of opportunity.
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>The Right Time</h4>
            <p>38SOG is primarily NA timezone, but has a substantial contingent
            of Australian and Kiwi players. We plan our operations at least 24
            hours in advance, to give everyone time to clear their schedule and
            be ready.

        <section>
          <h3>Small Unit Activities</h3>
          <p>38SOG isn't always trying to move the whole map. We spend a lot of
          time on small-unit activities, especially those that reward patience
          and preparation</p>
          <div class="infogrid">
            <div>
              <h4>Artillery</h4>
              <p>To shoot artillery in Foxhole is easy; to do it well is hard.
              38SOG members bring patience and discipline to artillery fire
              missions, in addition to hundreds of shells, allowing us to operate
              effectively and continuously.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Anti-Armor</h4>
              <p>Patience is a recurring theme in 38SOG's small unit gameplay,
              and it shines in our anti-armor work. Anti-tank weapons don't do
              well against structures or enemy troops, but sitting and waiting
              for our chance to strike means we're in position when the enemy
              finally makes their move.</p>

          <h3>Foxhole Tutorial Series</h3>
          <p>38SOG produces a series of short tutorial videos explaining
          important and non-obvious parts of the game. Check them out below.</p>
          <div>
            <h4>Reserve Stockpiles</h4>
            <p>Reserve stockpiles allow players to keep resources and equipment
            private and accessible only to people they choose. Using Reserve
            Stockpiles avoids the problem of trying to hide materials in unsafe
            places and hoping they won't get stolen. This tutorial shows all
            you need to know about Reserve Stockpiles and how they are used.</p>

        <h2>How to Get Involved</h2>
        <p>The 38th Special Operations Group is largely flat in its structure,
        but there is a small heirarchy of roles that serves as an on-ramp for
        new players. Here is how you get involved:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>Join the Discord</h4>
            <p>Join the 38SOG Discord using the link at the top of this page, and
            give us a brief introduction to yourself in the
            <span class="mono">#introductions</span> channel. Also, tell us how
            you found out about us!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Find the squad in-game</h4>
            <p>38SOG's in-game presence mostly revolves around the in-game
            squad. The squad allows us to have cross-region voice communications,
            and allows us to see who is online. You only have to join the squad
            once, and you'll stay in it even after you log out and log back in.</p>
            <p>38SOG's squad is usually called either "38SOG" or "38SOG.club". If
            you're having trouble finding it, ask on the Discord!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Become a Recruit</h4>
            <p>Once you join the squad, and someone with
            <span class="mono">[38SOG]</span> tags sees you in-game, you'll be
            given two roles on our discord: Colonial and Recruit. The Colonial
            role gives you access to our low-security set of Discord channels,
            which is where most of the discussion is. The Recruit role is so that
            we can ping you when we schedule events or operations.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Become an Auxiliary</h4>
            <p>Keep playing with us! After a few days, once we get to know you,
            you'll be given the Auxiliary role in Discord. This gives you
            access to our higher-security Discord channels, including the
            <span class="mono">#depot-codes</span> channel, which has our
            Reserve Stockpile codes.</p>
            <p>Auxiliaries are the bread and butter of 38SOG. Most people
            involved in 38SOG will be Auxiliaries. Auxiliaries are welcome to
            participate in our decision-making process and 
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Get Tagged</h4>
            <p>Joining the 38SOG regiment, and getting the
            <span class="mono">[38SOG]</span> tag in your name is, for most
            people, the fullest level of involvement. Getting tags tells the
            world that you're part of 38SOG. We expect the
            <span class="mono">[38SOG]</span> tag to carry with it a certain
            positive reputation, but that reputation doesn't necessarily mean
            "hundreds of hours of experience". Being a positive, helpful,
            patient, and welcoming player is the most important thing you can
            do.</p>
            <p>After a couple of weeks of playing, once we trust you to
            represent 38SOG with distinction, we will offer you tags. If you
            feel like we've forgotten about you, feel free to make a request.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Become a Member</h4>
            <p>Becoming what we call a "Capital-M Member" of 38SOG is the
            highest level of involvement you can pursue. Being a Member is not
            a privilege, it's a responsibility. It is not just being a part of
            38SOG, it's taking ownership over the it. 38SOG Members are
            collectively the final say on decisions made within the regiment.
            Once you're a Member, it's hard to remove you, so requests for
            Membership are taken very serious and require the very highest
            level of trust.</p>
            <p>Additionally, every Member of 38SOG has full administrator
            privileges on the Discord. If you're having technical troubles in
            Discord, a Member is who you want to talk to.</p>
